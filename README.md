## **The Discovery**
The **Unitary Loop** replaces "Ghost Variables" (Dark Matter/Energy) with a single mechanical constant: **Universal Drag ($H$)**.
### **The 0.49 Constant**
This is the mechanical "governor" of the universe. It explains why $c$ is a terminal velocity. In a pulsing **Living Sector**, motion is restricted by the viscosity of the medium itself.

## **Empirical Evidence**
### **The Oh-My-God Particle**
The highest-energy cosmic ray ever detected. Under the Unitary Loop, its energy is not an anomaly, but a demonstration of the **0.49 Lock**—the terminal velocity of the Living Sector.
### **GD-1 Stellar Stream**
The "gap and spur" observed in the GD-1 stream acts as a fluid-dynamic "wake." This is direct evidence of a viscous vacuum (Universal Drag) interacting with moving mass.
