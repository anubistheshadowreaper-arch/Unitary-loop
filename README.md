## **The Discovery**
The **Unitary Loop** replaces "Ghost Variables" (Dark Matter/Energy) with a single mechanical constant: **Universal Drag ($H$)**. 

### **The 0.49 Constant**
This is the mechanical "governor" of the universe. It explains why $c$ is a terminal velocity. In a pulsing "Living Sector," motion is restricted by the viscosity of the medium itself.
