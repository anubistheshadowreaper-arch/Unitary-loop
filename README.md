## **The Mission**
Einstein's 1917 Cosmological Constant ($\Lambda$) was not a "blunder"—it was a mechanical necessity. By identifying $\Lambda$ as **Universal Drag ($H$)**, the Unitary Loop Framework removes the need for "Ghost Variables" (Dark Matter/Energy) and resolves the $10^{120}$ Vacuum Catastrophe.

### **The 0.49 Constant**
This framework identifies an absolute mathematical ceiling for motion within a pulsing medium. The **0.49 Lock** explains why the Speed of Light ($c$) is a terminal velocity created by vacuum viscosity.

## **Empirical Evidence**
* **The Oh-My-God Particle:** High-energy cosmic rays hitting the "Drag Wall."
* **GD-1 Stellar Stream:** The wake left in the viscous vacuum.
* **Galactic Stability:** Achieved via friction, not invisible matter.
